2. The purpose of the scope resolution operator is 

	1. To access a global var when there is a local variable of the same name
	2. Defining a function outside of a class
	3. Accessing static members with the same name as a local variable
	etc...

3. As described in the powerpoint, friend functions are non-member functions that have access to public and non-public 
information. They are standalone functions. Can be declared as "friends" of another class within the class. 
Some negative aspects of friend functions are that they are loopholes in OOP and can cause confusion, if not implemented 
correctly, can cause breaks in data encapsulation and comprimise the integrity of "private" and "protected" elements of 
the class. Among other things, these are some key takeaways..

4. Yes, the class "Time" can have as many constructors has it wants. The constuctors however, will obviously constuct the
time object in different ways based on the parameters being passed into it. If no parameters, the constuctor will default 
whatever that time object is. If there are specific parameters set, then the object will be constructed as such.

5. It will simply be considered a method of the class...
Example:
class myclass{

public:
	myclass(){} //constuctor 
	void myclass{} //method of myclass


}
